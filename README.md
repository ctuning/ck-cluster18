*This project is hosted by the [cTuning foundation](https://cTuning.org).*

This repository contains a beta [Collective Knowledge](https://github.com/ctuning/ck) 
workflow to automate installation, execution, customization and validation of SeisSol application 
from the [SC18 Student Cluster Competition Reproducibility Challenge](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/sc18-announces-selected-paper-for-next-student-cluster-competition-reproducibility-challenge)
across different platforms, environments and datasets.

It supports our long-term community initiative to improve reproducibility of experimental results
from published papers, automate artifact evaluation, and help the community share code, 
data and workflows as reusable components: http://cTuning.org/ae .

See also [this CK repository](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-scc) to prepare digital artifacts for the Student Cluster Competition Reproducibility Challenge.
