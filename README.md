# CK Installation

The minimal installation requires:

* Python 2.7 or 3.3+ (limitation is mainly due to unitests)
* Git command line client.

You can install CK in your local user space as following:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/ctuning/ck
$ export PATH=$PWD/ck/bin:$PATH
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/ck:$PYTHONPATH
```

You can also install CK via PIP with sudo to avoid setting up environment variables yourself:

```
$ sudo pip install ck
```

# CK workflow installation with application dependencies
